I have downloaded the data set from "https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens".MovieLens 100K movie ratings. Stable benchmark dataset. 
100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies. Released 4/1998.

The python script is run on a Anaconda Prompt with spark, python and java installed.

The script is written to find out movie ratings. I have found the solutions as:-
1star 6110
2star 11370
3star 27145
4star 34174
5star 21201

Run the script: spark-submit ratings-counter.py
